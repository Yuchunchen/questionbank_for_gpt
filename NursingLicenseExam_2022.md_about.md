**Description of Nursing Data:**

This research utilized questions from the Taiwan National Nursing Licensing Exam of 2022 to evaluate the performance of the GPT-4 AI model. Extracted from the official website, the dataset comprised 400 questions across five test subjects: Basic Nursing, General Medicine, Medical-Surgical Nursing, Obstetrics and Gynecology Nursing, and Psychology and Community Nursing. 

Each question in the dataset underwent thorough review by human experts to identify its distinct characteristics. Such characteristics encompassed:

1. **Cognitive Level:** Determined by Bloom's taxonomy, questions were categorized based on the cognitive skills they required, ranging from lower-order thinking skills to higher-order thinking skills.
2. **Format of Questions:** While all questions generally followed a 'one stem, four choices' format, distinctions were drawn between Single-Answer Multiple-Choice (SAMC) and the more intricate Single-Answer Multiple-Response Multiple-Choice (SAMRMC).
3. **Clinical Vignette Inclusion:** Questions were distinguished based on the presence or absence of a clinical vignette, which portrays clinical scenarios.
4. **Polarity:** Questions were further segregated based on whether they were positively or negatively framed.

The GPT-4 AI model, guided by specific prompts, provided both answers and detailed explanations to each question. These AI-generated explanations were then examined by a human expert to derive what is termed as 'human-reviewed answers'. The collected dataset, with original questions and their respective characteristics, forms a comprehensive representation of the questions' design and the AI's performance in understanding and answering them.
